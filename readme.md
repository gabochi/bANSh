# bANSh

Because the world always need more bash, more bytebeat, more escape sequences, more ephemeral digital art.

# Use

There are two main scripts, **bansh.sh** prints 8-bit colored blocks (spaces with bg color) and **basch.sh** prints 'ASCII' characters with the current color configuration of your terminal by default (run `./basch.sh -c` for color).

Both have a default expression that's evaluated at start, press **CTRL+C** to edit the expression. Writing a `q` anywhere in the expression will quit the program.

The number of columns is automatically adjusted in concordance with the terminal configuration, therefore, I recommend to set the number of columns in powers of two (64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, etc.) for better results.

# test.sh

There is a third script that evaluates expressions in blocks of 64 returning the numerical results in order to practice and learn about expressions behavior.

# Tweak

The code is simple and short, edit the value of *s* variable to change the sleeping time after each line but remember that *printing is very CPU expensive*.
